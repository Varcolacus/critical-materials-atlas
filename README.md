# EU trade-dependency pipeline (Comext)

**Live atlas → https://varcolacus.github.io/eu_trade_dependency/**

Public-data demo: **who does the EU *really* depend on for critical raw materials?**
An atlas of **thirty-two** critical materials — essentially the full EU critical/strategic
raw-materials list — corrected for the transit-port distortion. The pipeline is parameterised
by CN code, so it generalises to any.

The point is methodological. The obvious way to read the data is the wrong one:

- **Naive — by importing member state.** Spreads "dependence" across DE / PL / NL
  and is distorted by the **Rotterdam/Antwerp effect**: goods are customs-cleared in
  NL/BE ports but bound elsewhere. This panel measures *logistics geography*, not
  dependence. It is the trap.
- **Corrected — EU as one entity, by country of origin.** For *extra-EU* imports the
  Comext `partner` field already **is** the country of origin, so this strips the
  transit distortion and shows who the EU actually relies on.

The headline chart puts the two side by side — that visible gap is the whole pitch.

## The atlas: thirty-two critical materials (2024, corrected to origin)

This is essentially the full EU critical/strategic raw-materials list — every material with
a clean CN8 code and recent data. The constant across all of them is that **the naive
member-state view is wrong**, and the corrected map is **global**: China is the single
largest source but the true origin of only **ten of the thirty-two** — under a third. The
two *most* concentrated dependencies aren't even China: **beryllium is 100 % US** and
**boron 98 % Turkey**. The EU leans on the US, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, Japan, Vietnam,
Russia, Chile, Gabon, Guinea, Algeria, Qatar, Norway, Mexico, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and
Australia — almost none visible in the member-state picture.

| Nickel | **Netherlands 39 %** | **Norway 33 %**, CA 18 % | 0.18 |

Highlights: the two sharpest dependencies are **non-China** — **beryllium** (100 % US) and
**boron** (98 % Turkey). **Hafnium** is the most extreme naive trap (Germany 88 % → the US).
New origins the member-state view erases entirely: **Guinea** (bauxite), **Gabon**
(manganese), **Japan** (strontium), **Vietnam** (phosphorus), **Algeria/Qatar** (helium),
**DRC** (copper). China is concentrated in the upper-middle (magnets, magnesium, arsenic,
germanium, graphite…), and the diffuse, low-risk cases (nickel, copper, helium, coking coal)
are themselves a finding — diversified, allied supply. Most series run 2010–2024 (magnets
only from 2023); the provisional latest year is excluded throughout.

## Method notes (the hard-to-fake bits)

- **Aggregate codes double-count.** The extract carries bloc reporters/partners
  (`EU`, `EA`, `EA21`, `EU27_2020`, `EXT_*`, `INT_*`, `WORLD`, `*_2020`) alongside the
  27 member states. If you don't drop them, origin totals inflate **~4.6×** while the
  *shares* stay ~92 % — so the error is invisible to anyone validating on shares alone.
  Both panels restrict reporters to the EU-27.
- **CN 8505 11 10 exists only from 2023** (CN8 code split / continuity break), so the
  series is deliberately short.
- **Extra-EU partner = origin.** This identity is what makes the correction possible;
  it does not hold for intra-EU flows.

## Run

Self-contained, base R only — no package installs.

```powershell
# Rebuild the whole atlas from the live Comext API — downloads every material (value +
# quantity) into raw/, then regenerates index.html and all charts. -EndPeriod defaults to
# the current year, so a new Comext release is picked up automatically:
powershell -File refresh.ps1

# To add one material: fetch it, then rebuild.
powershell -File download_data.ps1 -Product <CN8> -Label <name>
Rscript build_static.R
```

The Shiny app picks up every product fetched into `raw/` automatically — no code change.

`download_data.ps1` sends `Accept-Encoding: identity` to avoid gzip-as-text corruption
behind some proxies. Where R can reach Eurostat directly, the download can also be done
inside R — see the script header.

### Interactive dashboard

```r
# needs: shiny, ggplot2  (DT optional — enables a sortable table)
shiny::runApp(".")
```

Product + year selectors, the naive-vs-corrected chart, a multi-year trend,
value-vs-tonnage, a sortable origin table, and CSV downloads — all computed live from
`raw/` through the shared core, so the dashboard generalises to any product you fetch.

## Layout

- `comext-magnet-dependency-demo.R` — base-R batch pipeline (reads `raw/`, writes `out/`)
- `dependency_core.R` — shared base-R method (naive/corrected aggregation); sourced by
  both the pipeline and the app, so there is a single source of truth
- `app.R` — Shiny dashboard (reads `raw/` via the core)
- `index.html` — the **interactive tool** (Table / Map / Globe views + click-through detail),
  repo root = the **GitHub Pages** site; reads `out/data.json`
- `build_static.R` — regenerates `out/data.json` + the per-product PNGs in `out/`
- `refresh.ps1` — one command: re-fetch every material + rebuild the atlas (canonical
  product list lives here; `-EndPeriod` tracks the current year)
- `methodology.html` — self-contained one-page method note (the leave-behind)
- `download_data.ps1` — fetches Comext value + quantity for one product into `raw/`
- `raw/` — downloaded Comext data (gitignored)
- `out/` — generated `data.json` + PNGs (committed as the deliverable) + datasets (CSVs
  gitignored)

Public Eurostat (Comext) data only.
