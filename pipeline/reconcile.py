"""THE MOAT: reconcile mirror reports on the MONTHLY data. Every physical flow can be reported twice —
the exporter (FOB) and the importer (CIF, which includes freight+insurance). Where we have BOTH sides in
the same month, we reconcile them into one best estimate instead of picking a side (flows_best) or
trusting a raw feed (TDM). Method (a monthly, tractable cousin of CEPII BACI):
  1. canonicalize every row to (exporter, importer, hs6, period) and tag its side (FOB / CIF);
  2. keep the best SOURCE per side (deep national > wide reconciled > mirror), aggregated to HS-6;
  3. estimate the CIF/FOB (CAF/FAB) coefficient EMPIRICALLY from the matched pairs, PER PRODUCT -
     median cif/fob at HS6, falling back to HS4, HS2, then global, as BoP practice does;
  4. put both on a common FOB basis and take the geometric mean.
Output table `flows_reconciled` with `basis` = reconciled | exporter_only | importer_only_adj.

def _markup_table(con, glob):
    """A CIF/FOB (CAF/FAB) coefficient PER PRODUCT, not one number for everything.

    Balance-of-payments practice estimates this margin by product and transport mode, because
    freight is a far larger share of a tonne of ore than of a tonne of wire. We had one global
    figure, 1.023, and the pipeline's own ablation print already called it "too low for bulk".
    It was: estimated per HS2 the coefficient runs 1.177 for ores (HS26) against 1.011 for
    precious metals (HS71). Applying 2.3% to iron ore was never defensible.

    Estimated from the matched pairs, falling back up the nomenclature - HS6, then HS4, then HS2,
    then global - taking the first level with at least MIN_PAIRS well-behaved observations. Same
    HOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION ACTUALLY WORKS, since we got this wrong twice before checking.
    The compiler does not estimate the coefficient at all. In France the DOUANES produce it and
    the Banque de France applies it ("fabisation"); INSEE computes its own from transport-ministry
    data and gets a materially lower figure. And customs does not read it off the declaration
    either: the FAB value of an import is simply not collected, only the CAF value, so the ratio
    is measured by a dedicated SURVEY of transport and insurance costs - 10,000 representative
    transactions in the 2015 round - giving a rate of 3.3% (3.2% in 2009).
    Source: Douanes / DSEE, "Enquete sur les couts de transport et d'assurance", Jan 2016,
    lekiosque.finances.gouv.fr/fichiers/Etudes/thematiques/Etude_CAF_FAB_2015.pdf

    Two things follow, and both cut against how we do it.

    FIRST, the official rate is applied as ONE AGGREGATE NUMBER, "par souci de simplicite et de
    robustesse" - so our per-product table is more granular than what the Banque de France
    applies, not less. Granularity here is our choice, not a standard we are catching up to.

    SECOND, and more usefully, the survey DOES measure the variation it declines to apply, and it
    is an independent, freight-only benchmark for what we estimate from mirror gaps:

        by product   raw materials 2.0%   processed goods 3.4%   equipment 6.9%
        by mode      ship 6.1%   air 4.8%   road 2.5%   rail 2.3%
        by origin    neighbouring EU 1.1%   Americas 9.6%   Asia 7.7%
        by regime    intra-EU (DEB) 1.7%   extra-EU (DAU) 7.0%   raw materials, DAU 8.4%

    Our own coefficients run far above that ceiling: manganese ore 20.1%, tantalum 16.6%, bauxite
    15.6%, against 8.4% for extra-EU raw materials in the survey. Freight alone does not plausibly
    reach 20%. So the mirror gap we measure is NOT a freight margin - it is freight plus every
    reason two customs authorities disagree, and for bulk ores the second part dominates. The
    below-1.0 coefficients say the same thing from the other side. Treat these numbers as a
    reconciliation wedge, which is what they are, and never as a transport cost.

    That difference has a consequence worth stating rather than hiding. Two HS2 coefficients come
    out BELOW 1.0 - copper (HS74) at 0.964 and nickel (HS75) at 0.960 - and freight cannot do
    that: CIF is FOB plus transport, so the ratio cannot be less than one. What we are estimating
    is therefore not a pure freight margin; it is freight PLUS reporting asymmetry, and for those
    two the asymmetry dominates. So the APPLIED coefficient is floored at 1.0 (a coefficient that
    is impossible as freight should not be used as one), while the RAW median is kept beside it,
    because "the importer of copper systematically reports less than the exporter" is a finding,
    not an error to be clipped away.

    CEPII'S OWN METHOD, REPLICATED AND PARTLY DECLINED (6 Sep 2026)
    BACI does not take a median. It regresses the observed CIF/FOB ratio on gravity variables and
    a product-specific world median unit value, then applies the FITTED rate (Gaulier & Zignago
    2010); a companion paper computes the ratio from UNIT VALUES, each side normalised by its own
    declared quantity, which cancels the quantity-mismatch error (Gaulier, Mirza, Turban &
    Zignago 2008). Their published CIF/FOB dataset covers 1995-2004 only, so it cannot be applied
    to our window - but the method can be, and was, on our 1,039 matched pairs.

    Result 1, ADOPTED AS EVIDENCE, NOT AS CODE. The unit-value ratio is a far better behaved
    statistic than the value ratio we use:

                              median   in [1,2]   below 1 (impossible)
        value  CIF/FOB         1.002      30%          49%
        unit   CIFu/FOBu       1.071      50%          32%

    Half of our value-based ratios are below 1.0. And the unit-value median, 1.071, lands almost
    exactly on the Douanes survey's extra-EU rate of 7.0% - two independent methods agreeing, which
    is the strongest evidence in this whole file that ~7% is the real freight order of magnitude
    for extra-EU flows.

    Result 2, DECLINED. The gravity regression does not survive our sample size. On 517 usable
    observations across 30 products: R2 = 0.012, contiguity enters POSITIVE (neighbours should be
    cheaper to ship to, not dearer) and the unit-value term enters positive too (higher-value goods
    should carry a LOWER freight share). Two wrong signs and no explanatory power. BACI fits this
    on millions of flows; we have hundreds. The method is right and our sample cannot carry it.

    Result 3, WHY THE CODE DID NOT CHANGE. Switching the applied coefficient to unit-value ratios
    scores 0.6127 against BACI versus 0.6108 for the value ratios - marginally worse, though on a
    benchmark that is itself value-based and runs its own CIF/FOB model, so it cannot really
    arbitrate. More decisive: after the 1.10 ceiling the two methods barely differ - manganese ore
    x1.100 either way, bauxite x1.100 either way, copper cathode x1.000 vs x1.028. Threading
    quantities through the pipeline to move one coefficient by 0.028 is complexity that does not
    earn its keep, which is the same standard that removed reliability weighting from the
    estimator. The finding is recorded here because it is worth knowing; the code stays simple.
