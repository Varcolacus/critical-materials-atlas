"""THE MOAT: reconcile mirror reports on the MONTHLY data. Every physical flow can be reported twice —
the exporter (FOB) and the importer (CIF, which includes freight+insurance). Where we have BOTH sides in
the same month, we reconcile them into one best estimate instead of picking a side (flows_best) or
trusting a raw feed (TDM). Method (a monthly, tractable cousin of CEPII BACI):
  1. canonicalize every row to (exporter, importer, hs6, period) and tag its side (FOB / CIF);
  2. keep the best SOURCE per side (deep national > wide reconciled > mirror), aggregated to HS-6;
  3. estimate the CIF/FOB (CAF/FAB) coefficient EMPIRICALLY from the matched pairs, PER PRODUCT -
     median cif/fob at HS6, falling back to HS4, HS2, then global, as BoP practice does;
  4. put both on a common FOB basis and take the geometric mean.

# READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING ANY DISAGREEMENT RATE FROM THIS TABLE  (6 Sep 2026)
#
# The pipeline reports that 51% of two-sided flows disagree by more than 2x, and that the rate
# survives annual aggregation and the exclusion of entrepot hubs. Put to two independent reviewers,
# both said: not a finding, run the USA->CAN placebo, because US export statistics to Canada are
# largely DERIVED from Canadian import data and therefore cannot honestly conflict.
#
# The placebo failed, and tracing why found something worse than the corridor.
#
#     839 of the 1,039 matched pairs - 81% - are COMTRADE AGAINST COMTRADE.
#     907 of them are a SINGLE MONTH, December 2024.
#
# Because four of the five feeds hold exactly one month each: comtrade 202412, uscensus 202607,
# eurostat 202606. Only hmrc (25 months) and comexstat (20) have a series. So the "monthly
# five-source mirror reconciliation" is, today, one preliminary month of one source compared with
# itself, plus about 105 genuine cross-source pairs (Eurostat<->HMRC).
#
# In that month the USA->CAN corridor has an exporter side totalling $129m against an importer
# side totalling $2.5m, with cells like coal at $74.6m one way and $34.56 the other. That is not
# two statistical systems disagreeing. It is one incomplete monthly release.
#
# SO: the 51% describes preliminary Comtrade, not world trade statistics, and must not be
# published as the latter. The disagreement FLAG remains useful per flow; the RATE is not a
# finding until the feeds carry overlapping months from genuinely different compilers.

#           The rate is 51% at every value floor up to $100k and still 46% above $1m. The

def _markup_table(con, glob):
    """A CIF/FOB (CAF/FAB) coefficient PER PRODUCT, not one number for everything.

    Balance-of-payments practice estimates this margin by product and transport mode, because
    freight is a far larger share of a tonne of ore than of a tonne of wire. We had one global
    figure, 1.023, and the pipeline's own ablation print already called it "too low for bulk".
    It was: estimated per HS2 the coefficient runs 1.177 for ores (HS26) against 1.011 for
    precious metals (HS71). Applying 2.3% to iron ore was never defensible.

    Estimated from the matched pairs, falling back up the nomenclature - HS6, then HS4, then HS2,
    then global - taking the first level with at least MIN_PAIRS well-behaved observations. Same
    HOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION ACTUALLY WORKS, since we got this wrong twice before checking.
    The compiler does not estimate the coefficient at all. In France the DOUANES produce it and
    the Banque de France applies it ("fabisation"); INSEE computes its own from transport-ministry
    data and gets a materially lower figure. And customs does not read it off the declaration
    either: the FAB value of an import is simply not collected, only the CAF value, so the ratio
    is measured by a dedicated SURVEY of transport and insurance costs - 10,000 representative
    transactions in the 2015 round - giving a rate of 3.3% (3.2% in 2009).
    Source: Douanes / DSEE, "Enquete sur les couts de transport et d'assurance", Jan 2016,
    lekiosque.finances.gouv.fr/fichiers/Etudes/thematiques/Etude_CAF_FAB_2015.pdf

    Two things follow, and both cut against how we do it.

    FIRST, the official rate is applied as ONE AGGREGATE NUMBER, "par souci de simplicite et de
    robustesse" - so our per-product table is more granular than what the Banque de France
    applies, not less. Granularity here is our choice, not a standard we are catching up to.

    SECOND, and more usefully, the survey DOES measure the variation it declines to apply, and it
    is an independent, freight-only benchmark for what we estimate from mirror gaps:

        by product   raw materials 2.0%   processed goods 3.4%   equipment 6.9%
        by mode      ship 6.1%   air 4.8%   road 2.5%   rail 2.3%
        by origin    neighbouring EU 1.1%   Americas 9.6%   Asia 7.7%
        by regime    intra-EU (DEB) 1.7%   extra-EU (DAU) 7.0%   raw materials, DAU 8.4%

    Our own coefficients run far above that ceiling: manganese ore 20.1%, tantalum 16.6%, bauxite
    15.6%, against 8.4% for extra-EU raw materials in the survey. Freight alone does not plausibly
    reach 20%. So the mirror gap we measure is NOT a freight margin - it is freight plus every
    reason two customs authorities disagree, and for bulk ores the second part dominates. The
    below-1.0 coefficients say the same thing from the other side. Treat these numbers as a
    reconciliation wedge, which is what they are, and never as a transport cost.

    That difference has a consequence worth stating rather than hiding. Two HS2 coefficients come
    out BELOW 1.0 - copper (HS74) at 0.964 and nickel (HS75) at 0.960 - and freight cannot do
    that: CIF is FOB plus transport, so the ratio cannot be less than one. What we are estimating
    is therefore not a pure freight margin; it is freight PLUS reporting asymmetry, and for those
    two the asymmetry dominates. So the APPLIED coefficient is floored at 1.0 (a coefficient that
    is impossible as freight should not be used as one), while the RAW median is kept beside it,
    because "the importer of copper systematically reports less than the exporter" is a finding,
    not an error to be clipped away.

    CEPII'S OWN METHOD, REPLICATED AND PARTLY DECLINED (6 Sep 2026)
    BACI does not take a median. It regresses the observed CIF/FOB ratio on gravity variables and
    a product-specific world median unit value, then applies the FITTED rate (Gaulier & Zignago
    2010); a companion paper computes the ratio from UNIT VALUES, each side normalised by its own
    declared quantity, which cancels the quantity-mismatch error (Gaulier, Mirza, Turban &
    Zignago 2008). Their published CIF/FOB dataset covers 1995-2004 only, so it cannot be applied
    to our window - but the method can be, and was, on our 1,039 matched pairs.

    Result 1, ADOPTED AS EVIDENCE, NOT AS CODE. The unit-value ratio is a far better behaved
    statistic than the value ratio we use:

                              median   in [1,2]   below 1 (impossible)
        value  CIF/FOB         1.002      30%          49%
        unit   CIFu/FOBu       1.071      50%          32%

    Half of our value-based ratios are below 1.0. And the unit-value median, 1.071, lands almost
    exactly on the Douanes survey's extra-EU rate of 7.0% - two independent methods agreeing, which
    is the strongest evidence in this whole file that ~7% is the real freight order of magnitude
    for extra-EU flows.

    Result 2, DECLINED. The gravity regression does not survive our sample size. On 517 usable
    observations across 30 products: R2 = 0.012, contiguity enters POSITIVE (neighbours should be
    cheaper to ship to, not dearer) and the unit-value term enters positive too (higher-value goods
    should carry a LOWER freight share). Two wrong signs and no explanatory power. BACI fits this
    on millions of flows; we have hundreds. The method is right and our sample cannot carry it.

    Result 3, WHY THE CODE DID NOT CHANGE. Switching the applied coefficient to unit-value ratios
    scores 0.6127 against BACI versus 0.6108 for the value ratios - marginally worse, though on a
    benchmark that is itself value-based and runs its own CIF/FOB model, so it cannot really
    arbitrate. More decisive: after the 1.10 ceiling the two methods barely differ - manganese ore
    x1.100 either way, bauxite x1.100 either way, copper cathode x1.000 vs x1.028. Threading
    quantities through the pipeline to move one coefficient by 0.028 is complexity that does not
    earn its keep, which is the same standard that removed reliability weighting from the
    estimator. The finding is recorded here because it is worth knowing; the code stays simple.

#
# The trim is not cosmetic. Untrimmed the median is 1.071; trimmed it is 1.049, and the raw

# estimate here trims, and there is no reason the anchor should not.
#
# The trimmed figure is also the better match to the external benchmark, once the benchmark is
# read properly. The Douanes survey gives 7.0% for EXTRA-EU imports but 1.7% for intra-EU, and
# 3.3% overall. Our flows are a mix of both - Eurostat and HMRC contribute a lot of intra-EU
# trade - so the right comparator is not the 7.0% cell, it is somewhere between 1.7% and 7.0%.

#
# CAN THE LEVEL ITSELF BE BORROWED FROM CEPII, INSTEAD OF ANCHORED HERE? Tested, and no - for a
# structural reason rather than a missing-file one.
#
# Their intercept is not a free-standing number. It sits in an equation with YEAR EFFECTS covering
# 1995-2004, so the level it implies is the level OF THOSE YEARS. There is no 2024 dummy to apply,
# and the years since include the most extreme freight episode in modern shipping. The level is
# precisely the part of that model that is time-varying, so it is precisely the part that cannot
# travel. Geography could be borrowed because distance does not move; the constant cannot, for the
# same reason in reverse.
#
# Of the four blocks we omit, two ARE obtainable - World Bank GDP and GDP per capita cover 97% of
# our routes - and adding them was tested with CEPII's own coefficients (GDP_exp -0.005, GDP_imp
# -0.011, GDPpc_exp -0.047, GDPpc_imp +0.070). Not adopted, for two reasons:
#   - it pushes 70% of routes onto a bound (35% floor + 35% ceiling, against 58% before), so the
#     clipping would be doing more of the work than the model;
#   - the largest of the four, importer GDP per capita at +0.070, is explained by CEPII themselves
#     as a DEMAND effect, not a transport cost. We are trying to remove freight so two declarations
#     can be compared. Removing a demand effect is not that.
# Dropping just that one term and keeping the rest would be cherry-picking inside someone else's
# specification, which is worse than declining the block. The other two, infrastructure and the
# reporting-questionnaire dummies, we do not hold at all.

    This supersedes everything below it. The per-product medians, the borrowed CEPII 2008
    coefficients, the locally-anchored level and the freight ceiling of our own invention all
    existed because we believed no current published series covered this. One does, it is
    maintained, and it is built the way CEPII built theirs - reported CIF and FOB from ~30
    economies, gravity model for the rest - eighteen years further on.

    Two of our own numbers do not survive contact with it, and both were wrong in the same
    direction. We anchored on 4.9%, the OECD's headline GLOBAL margin - but that is across all
    products, and our basket is not all products. Across the 22 headings our trade actually uses,
    the 2022 median is 7.4%, and the bulk minerals run to 13%: phosphates 13.0, barytes 12.7,
    feldspar 12.5, borates 12.4, coal 12.0, bauxite 11.6. Against 3.2% for platinum and 3.7% for
    nickel. Our 10% ceiling was below the true margin for a whole class of the materials this
    atlas is about, and we would have gone on quietly clipping them.

    GRAIN: ITIC products are HS2017 HEADINGS. A 6-digit code takes its 4-digit parent's margin -
    HS17_2602 has data, HS17_260200 returns 404. Fallback order is pair-and-product, then product

    Robust + HONEST (per an adversarial review): a single global freight markup is a ROUGH PLACEHOLDER
    (real CIF/FOB is route/commodity/mode-specific). It's estimated only from well-behaved pairs (cif/fob
    in 0.7-1.5) so asymmetries don't distort it. Each two-sided flow is CLASSIFIED: if the two FOB-basis
    estimates agree (within 2x) -> reconcile with a SIMPLE geometric mean of the two sides. (We PREVIOUSLY
    used a reliability-inverse-variance-weighted geomean, but an ablation against the BACI benchmark showed
    equal weighting is marginally BETTER on ~180 flows — the weighting was complexity that didn't earn its
    keep at this sample size. The reliability metrics w_exporter/w_importer and exp_bias/imp_bias are STILL
    computed and EXPOSED as diagnostics of reporter behaviour; they just no longer drive the point estimate.
    Revisit weighting once the two-sided set is large enough for it to help.) If they DISAGREE we DO NOT fabricate a number (no 'keep-larger', which biases up and
    rewards misreporting): value_recon_fob = NULL, and both sides + the [lo,hi] range stay exposed with
    basis='disagreement'. For critical materials these conflicts are mostly HS ambiguity / re-exports /
    confidentiality, not freight — so exposing them (not smoothing them) is the actual value vs TDM (raw)
    and BACI (annual). BACI is kept as an EXTERNAL QA benchmark, never as an input to the estimate."""
